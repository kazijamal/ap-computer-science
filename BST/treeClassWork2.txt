1. Draw the resulting binary search tree from the sequence:
   	12, 8, 25, 7, 14, 1, 13, 25

                            12
                        /       \
                      8           25
                    /             /
                  7             14
                /             /    \
              1             13      25

2. The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path
   from root to leaf.

   What is the height of the tree constructed in question 1?
   
   3

3. A balanced tree is a tree that has the property that at each
   node the difference of the heights of each subtree are at most
   1.


   Is the constructed tree balanced?

    No; the height of the left subtree of 8 is 2, and the height of the right subtree of 8 is 0

4. Using the numbers from the sequence in question 1, provide a
   sequence of insertions so that after each insertion the tree
   is balanced.

    12,7,14,1,8,13,25,25

                    12

            7                   14

        1       8       13              25

                                    25

5. What is the expected runtime of building a BST if after each
   insertion the tree is balanced?

    O(NlogN) : N elements, logN to find insertion point for each element

6. What is the expected runtime of building a BST in the degenerate
   case?

    O(N^2) : N elements, N to find insertion point for each element
